Alche(me)
=========

Alche(me) requires you to delve into your dark subconscious in order to redeem you conscious self.

This is our entry in the Global Game Jam 2016.

The concept
===========

Following the theme (Ritual) it was agreed the game will be constructed in a Medival world with a first-person perspective.
The player's single goal is to reconstruct a stone artifact (which symbolizes "the self").  The pieces that must be retrieved and brought to accomplish this exist within the dark regions of the subconscious.
Time spent in this underworld continuously depletes the player's 'will' (health).  If this level reaches zero the player dies and the game has ended.

Once the ritual is complete (the artifact has been reconstructed) there is a redemption that takes place.  The 'secret' that must be gleaned by the player is that this requires an ultimate self-sacrifice.
